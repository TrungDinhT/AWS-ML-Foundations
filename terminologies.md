# Machine Learning terminologies

## Dataset
- **Impute**:  statistical tools to calculate missing values from dataset (e.g. replace them with mean/median, most frequent, zero/constsant values, etc.)
- **Outlier detection**: detect data points that are different from other data points in the sample (low density -> unsupervised learning task)
- **Novelty detection**: detect new data points (can be high density, but must be low density among known samples -> semi-supervised learning task)
- **FFNN**: Feed-forward neural network (layers after layers of fully connected neurons)
